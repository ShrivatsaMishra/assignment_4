# Assignment 4: Text Classification with Word Vectors

## Prerequisites

 - Install Anaconda

 - Create a new conda environment (in the Terminal):

    `conda create --name py39 python=3.9`
    
 - Activate the environment:

     `conda activate py39`

## Getting Started

  - Clone the repo, Enter the assignment directory
     
      ` git clone https://github.com/csci5832-f22/assignment_4.git `
      
      ` cd assignment_4 `
        
  - Install required libraries

     ` pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Tasks

  - Task A: Irony Detection in Twitter tweets with Twitter GloVe Vectors and Binary Logistic Regression (Total: 50 Points out of 100)
     - Fill in the missing code in [Irony Detection.ipynb](Part&#32;A&#32;-&#32;Irony&#32;Detection.ipynb)
  - Task B: Fake News Detection in Politifact texts using WorldNews Glove Vectors and MultiClass Logistic Regression (Total: 50 Points out of 100)
     - This is a completely written assignment. We will be focusing on another task for which the feature engineering is not straightforward: Fake News Detection. You will need to find the paper that presents state of the art (SotA) results for the dataset introduced in ["Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00648). Then, explain the model that achieves those results. And finally propose how you would improve on the results. You can use tools like https://scholar.google.com and https://www.connectedpapers.com in this task. (There will be extra credit if you show preliminary results of your implementations)
